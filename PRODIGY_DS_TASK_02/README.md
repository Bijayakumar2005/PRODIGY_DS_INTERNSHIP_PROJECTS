# Titanic Survival Analysis Project

![Titanic](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/RMS_Titanic_3.jpg/800px-RMS_Titanic_3.jpg)

## Project Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Titanic passenger survival data, focusing on patterns in survival rates. While the complete Titanic dataset typically includes passenger demographics, this analysis works with a simplified dataset containing only passenger IDs and survival status.

## Features
- Survival rate calculation and visualization
- Streak analysis of consecutive survival/non-survival patterns
- Cumulative survival tracking
- Passenger ID group analysis
- Comprehensive visualization suite

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Required packages:
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn

Install requirements with:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
Files
gender_submission.csv: Input data file (PassengerId, Survived)

titanic_analysis.py: Main analysis script

How to Run
Clone this repository or download the files

Ensure both files are in the same directory

Run the analysis script:

bash
python titanic_analysis.py
Expected Output
The script will:

Display basic dataset information

Calculate overall survival statistics

Generate four visualizations:

Survival distribution (pie chart)

Survival count (bar chart)

Survival/death streaks

Cumulative survivors

Print advanced analysis results

==================================================
1. BASIC DATA EXPLORATION
==================================================

First 5 rows of the dataset:
   PassengerId  Survived
0         892         0
1         893         1
2         894         0
3         895         0
4         896         1

Total passengers: 418
Number of survivors: 152
Number of non-survivors: 266
Survival rate: 36.36%
Visualizations
The script generates a 2x2 grid of plots showing:

Survival percentage breakdown

Absolute survival counts

Patterns in survival streaks

Cumulative survival over passenger IDs

Limitations
This analysis is limited by the simplified dataset. With the full Titanic dataset, we could analyze:

Class differences in survival

Gender survival patterns

Age group analysis

Family size impact

Embarkation port effects

Future Enhancements
Incorporate full Titanic dataset

Add machine learning predictions

Create interactive visualizations

Add hypothesis testing
