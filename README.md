***Data Science Internship at PRODIGY | June 2025***   

This repository contains the solutions and code for the 5 tasks completed during my 1-month Data Science internship at PRODIGY, spanning from June 1st to June 30th, 2025.

**Overview**   
During this internship, I engaged in a series of practical, hands-on tasks designed to deepen my understanding of core Data Science concepts and tools. Each task focuses on a unique aspect of the Data Science workflow, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model building, evaluation, and deployment strategies.

**Folder Contents**   
Task 1: Population Trends by Income Group (1960â€“2023)  
Task 2: Titanic Survival Analysis Project  
Task 3: Bank Marketing Campaign - Decision Tree Classifier  
Task 4: Social Media Sentiment Analysis  
Task 5: UK Traffic Accident Analysis  
Each folder contains the Python scripts/notebooks, datasets (if applicable), and a README or explanation document describing the approach and insights gained.  

**Key Skills Applied**   
Data cleaning and preprocessing
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Feature engineering
Statistical analysis and hypothesis testing
Machine learning modeling (Regression, Classification, Clustering)
Model evaluation and tuning
Data visualization
Reporting and documentation

**Objective**   
The goal was to apply theoretical knowledge in real-world Data Science problems and deliver actionable insights using industry-standard tools and methodologies.
